# Vibe Vault

Vibe Vault is a manga dematerialized shop, designed as a final project for a university module. The website is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to create an online platform where users can explore and purchase manga titles. 

## Technologies Used

### Front-end
- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Vuex: A state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications.
- Vue Router: The official router for Vue.js, used for handling client-side routing in the app.
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, used for structuring the website's content.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of the app's HTML elements.

### Back-end
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used to build the back-end API.
- MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system used to store and manage your app's data.
- Sequelize: A promise-based Node.js ORM for relational databases, used to interact with the MySQL database.

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to the Vibe Vault platform.
- Manga Catalog: Users can browse through a catalog of available manga titles.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for specific manga titles based on keywords or categories.
- Manga Details: Users can view detailed information about each manga title, including the author, description, and pricing.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add manga titles to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
- Order Management: Users can view and manage their orders, including tracking order status.
- Admin Panel: Admin users have additional features for managing manga titles, user accounts, and orders.

## Deployment

The Vibe Vault project is designed to be deployed on a cloud platform such as Heroku. The front-end and back-end components are deployed separately, with the front-end hosted as a static website and the back-end API hosted as a server.

To deploy the project, you would need to configure the necessary environment variables, set up the database connection, and ensure the required dependencies are installed.

## Project Limitations

It's important to note that Vibe Vault is a university project with certain limitations and simplifications. Here are some considerations:

- Scalability: While the project supports basic user registration, authentication, and e-commerce functionalities, it may not be optimized for large-scale usage. Additional considerations would need to be taken to ensure scalability and performance in a real-world application.
- Security: As a project developed for learning purposes, the focus was on functionality rather than advanced security measures. In a production environment, it would be important to implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Testing: Due to the scope of the project, extensive testing may not have been conducted. It's recommended to thoroughly test the application in a real-world scenario before deployment.

## Conclusion

The Vibe Vault project provided an opportunity to gain practical experience in web development using modern front-end and back-end technologies. It served as a learning platform for implementing e-commerce functionalities and user management systems. While it has some limitations, the project showcases the skills acquired throughout the university module and lays the foundation for further enhancements and improvements.
